# Emojeeeeez

## Description:
This is an amazing **Emoji Interpreter** application that I have build. It has a **dictionary** of Emoji and **the meaning**. When you click on the emoji, it tells you the meaning of emoji or you can simply search the emoji.

### Technologies Used:
1) JavaScript (React JS).
2) HTML.
3) Code SandBox.

#### What Next?
Add API for the emojis instead of the predefined Emoji Dictionary

#### How to contribute?

_I love building things, it does not matter whether the application is small or huge. So if you are new to this technology and eager to learn, we can go ahead and develop more features in the application._
